# Game_Stop_Sata
In January of 2021, a belief that Game Stock would declare bankruptcy led to users on Reddit shorted the Game Stop stock by borrowing shares of stock and immediately selling them. This caused the stock to reach just over $500, nearly 30 times the $17.25 valuation at the beginning of the month. This project uses Python time series analysis to track the rise and fall of the stock as well as models future stock prices. The time series begins in January 2021 just before a new board was announced and the subreddit group Wallstreetbets began shorting the stock.
